# LibX

## Overview
This project is a web application for library management where users receive personalized book recommendations based on similar descriptions (content-based filtering) or other similar users' preferences (collaborative filtering).

The project contains 2 APIs : the main Spring API that manages the books and users and the secondary one made with fast API that is refreshing the recommendations when it is triggered by adding/modifying/deleting books.
